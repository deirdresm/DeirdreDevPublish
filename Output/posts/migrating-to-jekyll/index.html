<p>First of all, I don't think it's news to anyone that 2020 has, to be polite, sucked. I lost a good part of my productivity this year (for months!) to COVID-19.</p><p>Because it's most illustrative of the kind of thing I've had to recover from, here's one of the challenges I had when COVID was at its worst in late January: rooms changed shape. I don't mean a little bit. I mean <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonic_solid">what platonic solid they were: cube to dodecahedron</a>, for example. ðŸ¤® The other was the wall suddenly sliding down the corridor away from me. While I was walking. ðŸ¤®</p><p>It's amazingly disconcerting not knowing how far walls, doors, floors are from you. I <em>knew</em> it was an illusion, and I knew I was ill and reported the symptom, but it was not of significant enough concern at that point to go to the ER. (This spatial distortion also happened in COVID-19 hospitalized and ICU patients on occasion, but sometimes they <em>didn't</em> know it was an illusion.)</p><h3>Thoughts on WordPress</h3><p>I wanted to move my site off WordPress, and managed to not have as good a backup as I'd hoped. I had a database backup that didn't import correctly, and I'd already canceled the hosting before double checking.</p><p>One of the things I relied on for my main site, which goes back to 1998, is that I'd converted it all to Markdown around 2006 when I first realized there were Markdown plugins for WordPress. Those plugins saved Markdown in a separate field and then the HTML-ified version in the main editing field.</p><p>Almost all third-party WordPress development on Markdown plugins stopped once Jetpack (an Automattic plugin) supported Markdown. Versions crept along, databases were converted from one major revision to the next.</p><p>I found that every time I'd log into my site to write a post, I'd spend enough time fussing with WordPress that I wouldn't actually <em>write the entries I went there for</em>. While WordPress had gotten out of my way oh so many years ago, now it was always in my way, and in very annoying ways. I stopped posting to my blog for over a year (extremely unusual).</p><h3>And Then There's Migration</h3><p>So I dumped my data, and then shut off my WordPress hosting. (Note: I knew better than to do this before the migration was final. I was just tired of the hassle, not to mention the cost.) I was unprepared for the annoyance of migration.</p><p>You see, the migration tools suck, and the import tools suck. The WordPress import tools have never imported images correctly, even from a WordPress export. That's just so broken.</p><p>And then I was hamstrung by something that's justâ€¦gobsmacking to me.</p><h3>The Markdown That Isn't</h3><p>First, let's look at a very simple WordPress post draft as it's being composed.</p><div class="12u$ image-wrapper" aria-label="WordPress Post Draft"><span class="image fit">
  <figure class="image">

    <a href="/assets/images/2020/10/wordpress-post-draft.jpg" title="WordPress Post Draft" target="_blank">

        <img src="https://deirdre.dev//assets/images/2020/10/wordpress-post-draft.jpg" alt="WordPress Post Draft" />

    </a>


      <figcaption>WordPress editor window view of post being composed. Edited text reads: This is a new post, and my default is set to markdown.</figcaption>

  </figure>
</span></div><p>But here's how it's actually being stored in the database:</p><div class="12u$ image-wrapper" aria-label="WordPress Post Draft in MySQL"><span class="image fit">
  <figure class="image">

    <a href="/assets/images/2020/10/wordpress-post-draft-db.jpg" title="WordPress Post Draft in MySQL" target="_blank">

        <img src="https://deirdre.dev//assets/images/2020/10/wordpress-post-draft-db.jpg" alt="WordPress Post Draft in MySQL" />

    </a>


      <figcaption>WordPress Post Draft in MySQL shows that this is HTML wrapped in comments, *not markdown*.</figcaption>

  </figure>
</span></div><p>In text format:</p><pre><code>&lt;-- wp:paragraph --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;<span class="type">This</span> <span class="keyword">is</span> a new post, and my <span class="keyword">default is set</span> to markdown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
</code></pre><p>While putting HTML comments and paragraphs isn't <em>forbidden</em> in Markdown, of course, the idea that you'd <em>only</em> store garbage like that in lieu of the plain text you claimed to store is very much not only against the spirit of Markdown, but deceptive to one's customers.</p><h3>And Here We Are</h3><p>Despite all that, I did get the site migrated, and glad to be migrated. Looking forward to writing more, now that I won't be quite so annoyed by my blog any more. :P</p><h4><em>Photo Credit</em></h4><figcaption>Monarch Butterflies on tree branch in blue sky background, photo by JHVEPhoto/Depositphotos, used with permission</figcaption>
