<p>I'd been asked to talk about women getting into programming this week, but my situation is <em>really</em> unusual and the timing turned out to be horrible. You see, the person who got me into programming, my father, recently died.</p><p>Let's rewind to my junior year in high school, when, in order to get a leg up on college, I started taking classes at the local community college while still attending high school. I was also in band, marching band, orchestra, and choir (at the same time), so arguably I had no time for such things.</p><p>My dad had become a particle physicist in order to avoid the draft during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_War">Korean War</a>. After grad school, he worked primarily in aerospace and had a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viking_lander_biological_experiments#Gas_chromatograph_â€”_mass_spectrometer">project land on Mars on the first Viking Lander</a>. By this time, his work had shifted from particle physics to mass spectrometers.</p><p>A lot of his work required programming, and he basically disliked it. He didn't mind doing the design, but he really disliked all the arguing with compilers. Me? I was a shy kid who desperately feared being wrong in front of other people. But a machine telling me I'd made an error didn't bother me at all. So I took a programming class. To my surprise, I enjoyed it.But</p><p>For years, I worked for my dad or on teams where he worked (sometimes as a contractor, sometimes as an employee), working on everything from power plant control systems to <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/JA083iA12p05685">science experiments</a> to the Hubbard Space Telescope. I did everything from write device drivers to applications, mostly on very small one-off systems.</p></article>
