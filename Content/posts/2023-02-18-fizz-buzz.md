#  Hello FizzBuzz, My Old Friend

There are two common approaches to solving the classic FizzBuzz problem, printing different things on different conditional tests. I'll discuss those later.

There is a third way, using a `switch` statement, that's more idiomatic Swift, specifically:

```swift
for i in 1...100 {
	switch (i % 3, i % 5) {
	case (0, 0):	// divisible by both 3 and 5
		print("FizzBuzz")
	case (0, _):	// divisible by 3
		print("Fizz")
	case (_, 0):	// divisible by 5
		print("Buzz")
	default:
		print("\(i)")
	}
}
```

The short explanation: you're testing for modulo remainders on both 3 and 5 at the same time. Swift allows for more complex case statements than other languages, plus the wonderful _ DGAF option.

This is used in job interviews (I've been asked it several times) in order to see if you can handle logic that is more complex than one conditional test.
